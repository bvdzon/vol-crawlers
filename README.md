# Vol::crawlers
Welcome! This project is in very early and experimental stage, and help in the following areas would be greatly appreciated!
 
This repository contains the crawlers used to find volunteering gigs.
 
How you could help:
* **Non technical:** Add support for new countries by raising an issue to support your country, and include sites that you would like to be included
* **Technical:** Help writing new or extending current crawlers
